## 📧 **Contact Form Setup**

I've included a working contact form using **FormSubmit.co**:

### **How it Works:**
1. User fills form on your site
2. FormSubmit sends email to: **rivic.revan.ande@gmail.com**
3. You receive instant notification
4. User gets confirmation page

### **First-Time Activation:**
**IMPORTANT**: The first time someone submits the form, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to **rivic.revan.ande@gmail**.com. You MUST click the confirmation link to activate.
